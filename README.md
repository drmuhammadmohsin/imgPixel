# Understanding Image Concepts for Object Detection

## Image Pixels, Pixel Density, Resolution, DPI, and PPI

In digital imaging, an **image** is composed of tiny units called **pixels**. Each pixel represents a single point in the image, and together they form the complete picture. The total number of pixels in an image defines its **resolution**. For example, an image with a resolution of **1920x1080** contains 1920 pixels horizontally and 1080 pixels vertically, resulting in a total of over 2 million pixels.

### Pixel Density: PPI vs DPI
**Pixel Density** refers to the number of pixels packed into a given area, typically measured in **PPI (Pixels Per Inch)** for digital displays and **DPI (Dots Per Inch)** for printed images. The higher the PPI or DPI, the sharper and more detailed the image. For example:
- **PPI** is commonly used to describe the density of pixels in screens or monitors.
- **DPI** is more commonly used in printing and refers to the density of ink dots on paper.

Higher pixel density improves the clarity of fine details. For example, in object detection or image classification tasks, higher pixel density allows for better recognition of smaller features.

### Image Resolution
**Resolution** refers to the number of pixels in an image, described in terms of width x height. For example, a **3280x2464** resolution image has 3280 pixels along its width and 2464 pixels along its height. Resolution is a critical factor for image clarity, especially in tasks such as automated image analysis where fine details must be identified.

### Application Example: Waste PCB Image Capture
For this project, we captured images of Waste Printed Circuit Boards (WPCBs) using a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) with a resolution of **3280x2464 pixels**. This high resolution ensures that even small electronic components on the PCBs are visible in detail, which is critical for tasks such as object detection and automated classification using deep learning algorithms.

The Raspberry Pi camera outputs high-resolution images with sufficient pixel density to detect intricate details on waste PCBs, which are crucial for accurate component identification and classification.
